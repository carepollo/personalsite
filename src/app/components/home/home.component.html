            I am a Software Engineering student, I have experience in Web dev (Full-Stack) and I am interested in Transhumanism.
            I love all the topics related to CS, CE and Sci-Fi, I've been coding for approximately 4 years by now. I am still looking for a specific branch to specialize in. Linux (current distro: EndeavourOS) is my main and favorite OS.
